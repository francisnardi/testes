Dear AIM Reconciliation Team,

Unfortunately, I have not received any contact from XP via email regarding the confirmation of my documentation. However, I agree to the inclusion of my XP investments in the automatic monitoring/sharing with Bank of America's AIM.

I am available for any further clarifications or additional actions as needed.

Thank you and best regards,
