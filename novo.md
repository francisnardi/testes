**Subject:** Term Resubmission Due to Corrected Account Number  

Dear Yolanda,  

I hope this message finds you well.  

I managed to contact XP by phone, and they informed me that the term was not approved because I mistyped my account number (I entered 4217802 instead of the correct 4217805).  

I have corrected this and updated the term with the accurate account number and current date. I kindly ask if you could resubmit it on my behalf, as I am unable to send external emails from my account (francisco.nardi@bofa.com).  

XP mentioned they will approve it within a few days once they receive the corrected version.  

I apologize for the delay and any confusion caused. Thankfully, we identified the issue, and it is now being addressed.  

Thank you very much for your understanding and assistance.  

Kind regards,  
Francisco Nardi
