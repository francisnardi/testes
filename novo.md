**Subject:** Resubmission of Corrected Term  

Dear Yolanda,  

How are you?  

I contacted XP by phone, and they informed me that the term was not approved because I mistyped my account number (I entered 4217802 instead of the correct 4217805).  

I have corrected this and updated the term with the accurate account number and current date. Could you kindly resubmit it on my behalf, as I am unable to send external emails from my account (francisco.nardi@bofa.com)? Please send the documents again to the following addresses, as was done previously:  

- **Acordos Compliance - XP Investimentos:** acordoscompliance@xpi.com.br  
- **Acordo de Compliance Cadastro - XP Investimentos:** acordocompliancecadastro@xpi.com.br  

XP mentioned they will approve it a few days after receiving the corrected version.  

I apologize for the delay and any confusion caused. Thankfully, we identified the issue, and it is now being addressed.  

Thank you very much for your understanding and assistance.  

Kind regards,
