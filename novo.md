Dear Yolanda,

How are you?

I contacted XP by phone, and they informed me that the term was not approved because I mistyped my account number (I entered 4217802 instead of the correct 4217805).

I have corrected this and updated the term with the accurate account number and current date. Could you kindly resubmit it on my behalf, as I am unable to send external emails from my account (francisco.nardi@bofa.com)? Please send the documents again to the following addresses, as was done previously:

Acordos Compliance - XP Investimentos: acordoscompliance@xpi.com.br
Acordo de Compliance Cadastro - XP Investimentos: acordocompliancecadastro@xpi.com.br
XP mentioned they will approve it a few days after receiving the corrected version.

I apologize for the delay and any confusion caused. Thankfully, we identified the issue, and it is now being addressed.

Thank you very much for your understanding and assistance.

Kind regards,
