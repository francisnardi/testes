Hi Sandra,

How are you?

Apologies for the inconvenience, but I’d like to kindly request your attention regarding the following matter:

Action Required
Transaction Request: 449946
Department: FX Ops Brazil

Could you please provide an update or any progress related to this request?
We’d like to proceed with the tests in UAT as soon as possible, even if it’s initially with a simple file, such as a .txt.

I truly appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
